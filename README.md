# three-d-viewer

## Important
At start, this realisation deserves to provide a great 3D viewer based on ThreeJS for this project : https://elevationapi.com/playground_3dbbox

I decide to create a repo, the viewer is a VueJS component whose the code can be adapted for React, Angular, CommonJS, etc...

The viewer is not finished : The SAO and anisotropy don't work, we can't load models with multiple mesh and materials, we can load only STL or GLTF (+ GLB) format, we can't chose a file from the computer (must put the file in public/assets/3dmodels).

Ultimately, I would like to create a very cool 3D viewer based on ThreeJS (WebGL) with customable and easy-to-use JS components, with a GUI

Enjoy ! :)
